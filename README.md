# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project explores Walmart sales data to identify top-performing branches and products, examine sales trends, and understand customer behavior. The primary goal is to study how sales strategies can be optimized. The dataset was obtained from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting).

In this competition, participants are provided with historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across different regions. Each store contains several departments, and the task is to forecast sales for each department in each store. Holiday markdown events are included, affecting sales unpredictably, making it a challenge to project the extent of these impacts.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into Walmart's sales data to better understand the factors that influence sales performance across different branches.

## Dataset Description

The dataset was sourced from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting). It contains sales transactions from three Walmart branches, located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The data consists of 17 columns and 1,000 rows:

## Analytical Goals

### Product Analysis
- Analyze different product lines to determine which are performing well and which need improvement.

### Sales Analysis
- Identify sales trends to evaluate the effectiveness of sales strategies and suggest improvements to boost sales.

### Customer Analysis
- Study customer segments, their purchasing trends, and profitability to better target future marketing efforts.

## Approach

1. **Data Wrangling:**
   - The data is inspected for missing or **NULL** values, which are addressed using appropriate methods.

   Steps:
   - Build the database.
   - Create the table and insert the data.
   - Since we used **NOT NULL** constraints, no missing values are present.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Generate new columns from existing ones to extract insights.

   New features:
   - `time_of_day`: Classifies transactions into Morning, Afternoon, or Evening.
   - `day_name`: Extracts the day of the week from the date.
   - `month_name`: Extracts the month of the transaction.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform analysis to answer the questions and objectives laid out in the project.

## Revenue and Profit Calculations

- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):**
  \[
  COGS = unitPrice \times quantity
  \]

- **VAT (Value Added Tax):**
  \[
  VAT = 5\% \times COGS
  \]

- **Total Sales:**
  \[
  total(gross_sales) = VAT + COGS
  \]

- **Gross Profit (Gross Income):**
  \[
  grossProfit = total(gross_sales) - COGS
  \]

- **Gross Margin:**
  \[
  \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{gross income}}{\text{total revenue}}
  \]

### Example Calculation
For the first row in the dataset:
- **Unit Price:** $45.79
- **Quantity:** 7

1. **COGS:**
   \[
   COGS = 45.79 \times 7 = 320.53
   \]

2. **VAT:**
   \[
   VAT = 5\% \times 320.53 = 16.0265
   \]

3. **Total Sales:**
   \[
   Total = 16.0265 + 320.53 = 336.5565
   \]

4. **Gross Margin Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{16.0265}{336.5565} \approx 4.76\%
   \]
